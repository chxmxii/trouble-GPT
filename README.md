As I've been learning ansible and python lately, I Had the idea to start working on an ansible module to wrap my skills.

## Description: 
+ this project would be an Ansible module that allows users to troubleshoot issues that arise when running Ansible playbooks on a host. The module would capture any error messages that occur during playbook execution, and then send the error message, along with any relevant context or information about the host and playbook, to a language model API. The API would then provide a response that includes information about the cause of the error and potential solutions for resolving it. The module would format the API response in a way that is easy to understand and apply, and present it to the user.

+ The module would be able to handle authentication with the language model API and have the necessary inputs and outputs to function properly. It would use API endpoints such as `debugging`, `troubleshooting` or `error-resolution` to get the information needed.

+ This module would help users to troubleshoot issues more quickly and efficiently, reducing downtime and improving the overall reliability of their infrastructure.
### How does it works?
1. Captures any error messages that occur when running an Ansible playbook on a host.
2. Sends the error message to the language model API, along with any relevant context or information about the host and playbook that were being run
3. Retrieves the response from the API, which should include information about the cause of the error and potential solutions for resolving it.
4. Formats the response in a way that is easy to understand and apply, and presents it to the user.
--------------------------------------------------
Check List: 
1.  Create a new directory for the module, and give it a name, such as "ansible-troubleshoot".
2.  Inside that directory, create a Python file with the same name as the directory, and use that as the entry point for the module.
3.  Import the necessary libraries, such as `ansible.module_utils.basic` and `requests` to make API calls.
4.  Define the inputs and outputs for the module using the `AnsibleModule` class, in order to specify what arguments the module takes and what it returns.
5.  Handle the authentication with the API key, by adding the key as a variable and including it in the API calls headers.
6.  Build the API request to the troubleshooting endpoints, by specifying the endpoint URL and the request data as JSON.
7.  Send the API request and handle the response, by using the `requests.post()` method, and raise an error if the status code is not `200`.
8.  Extract the useful information from the API response, so it could be passed to the user in an understandable format.
9.  Use the `module.exit_json()` function to return the results to Ansible.
